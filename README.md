# FilterApp
Simple Webgl (PixiJs) app for apply shaders in photos . Upload a photo and apply filters, you can save it and even you can use your own filters using the variables in the 
left navbar. It must be a .frag file (glsl). You can also upload videos and apply filters but for now they cannot be downloaded
